## Common Gotchas

### Hot-reload not working (or always showing a previous change)

Hot reload doesn't work properly in the root `App.js` component. Converting the `App.js` to a _class_ component may help (see https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/4957).
Try adding a change in a _child_ component to see if hot reloading is working for you.

## Selection of libraries

### Context menu

Background: When user does a long press on a list item, we need to display a [context menu](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/menus-and-actions/context-menus) with items that allow to perform a common operations with this list:

1. Edit the list information (title, color, icon).
2. Delete the list (destructive, irreversible action).
3. Share a list (ideally, in a form of an [App Clip](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/)).

Also, the visual requirements would be:

* The context menu should look native (system colors, icons, seperators, etc.).
* The selected list item should become semi-transparent.
* The background behind the selected list item should become blurred.

A desirable output:

(Credit and inspiration - [ToDo List app](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/to-do-list-tasks-reminders/id1476066606?l=pl))

Choosing a library that would satisfy all these requirements turned out to be a non-trivial task.

### Options

* [react-native-hold-menu](https://github.com/enesozturk/react-native-hold-menu)
* [react-native-context-menu-view](https://github.com/mpiannucci/react-native-context-menu-view)
* [@react-native-menu/menu](https://github.com/react-native-menu/menu)

#### react-native-hold-menu

**Pros**:

* Pure React Native solution (doesn't use native UIMenu, implements its own React component). The benefit is that you can install and use this library easier, without having to create a development build for Expo, for example.
* No issues with navigation, - separates press and long-press very well, so they aren't triggered both on a long press.
* Handles menu positioning well (drop to top, drop to bottom).
* Declarative definitions for the menu item handlers (`onPress` is provided for a menu item directly)

**Cons:**

* Pure React Native solution. The drawback is that using the menu component provided by the OS guarantees it functions properly in the future OS releases.
* A consequence of the previous item, - it doesn't match the native context menu visually and, overall, immediately gives a sense of "non-nativeness":
  * Uses different font and font colors for menu items (e.g., the red is too red, and it's immediately aparent for an iOS user).
  * Doesn't use system icons, which also is very aparent.
  * The menu separator is slightly different (wider).

* The blur behind a selected item also feels different (this is strange, because it uses `expo-blur`, which claims to use the native `UIView`-blur component)
* It's not possible to customize the "preview item" (the item we've long-pressed to trigger the context menu).
* The API is slightly awkward, mainly for using icons.
* It's very early in beta (`v0.1.5`), and the author himslef doesn't reccomend to use this lib in producton ðŸ¤·.

#### react-native-context-menu-view

**Pros:**

* Native solution (icons, fonts, colors, separators - everything mathches).
* Customisable "preview item".
* Support for a dropdown version.
* Blur behind the preview item feels good.
* In `v1.9.0`, which seems good.

**Cons:**

* Issue with navigation. The long-press action almost always triggers the short press, which is bound to opening a list details screen.
* Very strange API, to say the least:
  * `onPress` on the `<ContextMenu />` element isn't related to this element at all. Instead, it should _imperatively define_ all onpress actions for _all_ menu items at once.
  * To define a separator between menu items, you have to do some weird trick like defining a sub-group of `actions` inside a top-level `action` and combine this with `inlineChildren: true` parameter. Not only this is wasteful and error-prone, it also contradicts its own _type declarations_ and makes TypeScript mad at you!

#### @react-native-menu/menu

**TODO:** let's try this beast
